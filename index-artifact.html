    <header2>_METHOD</header2>
    <header3>_01. Digital traces in the future past</header3>
    <header4>_01.1 NEW CALLIGRAPHIC DIMENSION</header4>
    <p></p>
    <div>The research is developed through drawings as investigative tools of enquiry, within the discourse between art and science where performative calligraphies of space involve scientific aspects that are strictly data-driven. Scientific tools provide a new lens through which investigate space that would otherwise remain invisible.
      <br></br>
      Computation becomes a process tool in which the interaction between the digital and the physical finds new calligraphic dimensions. The ground for research becomes the interdisciplinary debate between art and science. This need to search for a new language has always been part of the practice of architecture, manifesting itself in a more marked way in the contemporary context, in which we observe a constant push towards technological progress. We abandon modernist thought and representation, which is no longer effective for contemporary dynamics, and introduce new performative calligraphies, understood as new languages and representative methods generating aesthetic forms able to shape the physical environment. Within the contemporary discourse, new technologies and visual arts have evolved in search of new methods of expression by crossing interdisciplinary boundaries with the consequence that we no longer consider creativity and scientific data as two distinct issues. In this way, the architect-designer makes it possible to contribute to the construction of critical knowledge, using aesthetic tools as a means to address new contemporary issues.
    <br></br>
    The semantic experiment of performative calligraphies sees in the meanings of the two distinct words a possible intersection in which to investigate and experiment with a new method for design practice.
    <br></br>
    In particular, Performativity in linguistics means expressions that do not have a descriptive function but consist of performing an actual action. <div class="hovertext" id="hover1">Performative</div> utterances are sentences that not only describe a given reality but also change the social reality they describe. At the same time, <div class="hovertext" id="hover2">Calligraphy</div>, in its earliest roots, has been defined as a possible instrument to indulge in art as a form of communication.
In a future in which systems are built on complex processes and layers, functions and phenomena that are impossible to map in the proper way, calligraphy will no longer show letters or signs. Still, it will change its scale and volume to become the subject of performative acts, in which action and movement become inseparable from the data structure.
</div>
    <p></p>






    <header4>/01.1</header4>
  
    <header5>_01.2 DATA STRUCTURE</header5>
    <p></p>
    <div>
      The scientific datum is an object of design and can therefore be analysed from an aesthetic point of view, taking into account its intrinsic characteristics, like any other artefact.  Removing the gap between the scientific-mathematical representation and the dynamic-aesthetic one allows the structure of the datum to acquire a performative dimension, and the use of certain languages and codes allows us to generate new conventions in which the physical space becomes the background of a new interaction between the digital and the tangible.
      <br></br>
      The production of an experimental calligraphic language thus has a critical value in itself, which consists of investigating the generation and manipulation of data in a hypothetical future as a new design tool. 
    <br></br>
    Data are stored in the digital environment and physical in two different ways. 
    <br></br>
    Digital space is created by alphanumeric formulas and strings of letters, chains of words capable of generating new futures. In this context, the concept of calligraphy takes on different forms. 
    Calligraphic characters shift from physical to virtual space, taking values and becoming triggers and inputs to a virtual space. The new calligraphies collect data and manipulate it. What are the performance and relationship between our control of the body in space and its interaction with technology in its dimension of continuous evolution?
    <br></br>
    What is the <div class="hovertext" id="hover3">barrier</div> where physical space and its continuous data sensing in space meets digital data processing? How can we as designers work on this point of discontinuity?

    </div>

    <header7>_01.3 HUMAN - MACHINE</header7>


<P></P>
<div>
  In the discipline that observes the human body as the subject of the digital computer, both as a physical source and as a computational power force, the computer thus becomes the primary tool of numerous professional and non-professional practices, and the human body becomes an actor in a specific performance game.
  Machine and human make demands on each other, and "any tool, soft or hard, is a mechanistic approximation of a narrow and codified aspect of human behaviour. [...] Tasks which are simple and open to variation for a person, must be specified and constrained when embodied in a machine" (Penny 1996).
<br></br>
In codification processing, the processes that try to find the codified rules in a given system are investigated. Most humans find difficulty in the immediate comprehension of encoded algorithmic systems because some systems contain so many encoded abstractions that it is sometimes impossible to comprehend their overall functioning fully. For this reason, encoding affects comprehension and the machine does not have the total power to transmit the knowledge of the abstractions it encodes in space.
In a realm of ideas far from human consciousness, the machine becomes the black box, and the process that links conceptualisation to physical realisation is destroyed. (Penny 2011)
<br></br>
In this process, the human who uses the machine that makes the thing hardly learns how to make the thing itself but learns to understand the behaviours and identify the patterns the machine acts to reproduce and evolve them.
<br></br>
Technological evolution, therefore, no longer sees humans acting towards an aim as puppet-masters of numerous devices but tries to replace that system of wires that previously had to be manipulated by a human being in the physical world with digitised systems.
Digital computers, being skilled and agile at executing statistical models, become agents that make decisions in the presence of uncertainty by processing data where morality is not determined by moral values but by numerical ones.
<br></br>
The human is thus faced with uncertainty since a predefined decision is an invented hypothesis (according to <div class="hovertext" id="hover4">Occam's Razor</div>). Designers would violate this assumption if they chose among the numerous hypotheses the one that makes the fewest assumptions, the simplest.
When the same moral decisions are encoded and executed by digital computers, "to return to being moral and human, it seems that we must always tear ourselves away from instrumentality, reaffirming the sovereignty of ends" (Latour 2002).

    <header2>_AS PRACTICE</header2>
    <header3>_02. Dimensions of testing grounds</header3>
    <header4>_02.1 FINGERS AS MEDIUM</header4>
    <P></P>
    <div>Shifting and dragging these theoretical concepts into an experimental project on which the method could be tested, the human-machine/physical-digital relationship sees the example of the keyboard and human fingers as a tangible ground on which to sample tools and speculate on possible future scenarios.
    
      <br></br>
      In the practical exploration of this new dimension of space, the portal to access strings of alphanumeric information becomes our fingers, which gain power and control in physical space over the writing of data that once processed transmute into abstract forms, chains of words are visualised in digital space and become indispensable design and communication tools of the everyday scenario.
  
    <br></br>
    At present, we use keyboards to write codes, scripts, different computer languages support us in programming the digital world, and the keyboard officially becomes the most widely used design tool for many users.
    In everyday life, we could imagine the amount of time we spend connected to the digital world through screens, where our fingers act as mediums, typing thoughts words and actions in public social spaces of sharing. What if we start imagining the digital space as a public one, able to process the thoughts, sentences and words of thousands of people.
    <br></br>
    Based on this assumption, the concept of digital space as a public space in which people act through written sentences becomes a developing ground for the prototype, in which numerous human-machine interactions can be processed.
    A website becomes the portal of access to the code that can map the letter frequency of sentences written by users both in relation of both human state of mind and the ability of the machine to process a sentiment-analysis on the same chain of letters in order to obtain a data collection that has a specific visual output that can be traced back to a gradient of intensity with respect to human-keyboard interaction.
    <br></br>
    At the same time while the digital environment is collecting information about letter frequency and human behaviour also numerically calculating our emotions, in the physical environment fingers moving on the keyboard are producing other kind of data which belong to other properties, other dimensions and new forms. New aesthetic forms that can be written in the space.
    How can these forms perform in the space? What if in a near future, the only way to perform a spatial practice is to obtain a critical merge and combine these two different dimensions?

    <header5>_02.2 DRAWING MACHINES</header5>
    <P></P>
    <div>
      Drawing as shared knowledge between intelligences.
      <br></br>
      Data can be written differently in space. A reflection can be made on the power of drawing as a means of shared knowledge between humans and machines, two intelligence that faces each other in a gesture of tracing and inscription. The prototype of the drawing machine becomes a tool for consideration that looks to the future by exploiting previous past mutations. Through numerical control systems, these machines conceptually reduce the practice of drawing to a disembodied action, once again redounding to the inability of man as a single intelligence to transfigure innumerable numerical data with precision.
      <br></br>
      The evolution of the drawing machine concept sees in the example of some prototype case studies the possibility of constructing new future scenarios on the principle of this machine.
      <br></br>
      For instance, considering a hypothetical future 2040, and by analysing the evolution of the system over the last 20 years to predict the next ones, we find some useful tools to define the concept behind the transmission of data between different dimensions of space.
      <br></br>

In 2001, Eva and Franco Mattes presented <div class="hovertext" id="hover5">Biennale.py</div> at the 49th Venice Biennale.
A machine able to draw the characters of a computer virus (digital-digital), immaterial and self-replicating, when the virus enters a computer it remains hidden there, trying to survive as long as possible.

In 2013, an example of work related to calligraphy as a writing and communication tool was made by Robert Twomey which attempted to answer <div class="hovertext" id="hover6">John Searle's Chinese room</div> question by exploring writing and child language as protolanguages. The system thus consists of speech synthesis systems and a mechanical apparatus capable of drawing the child's speech, which is then interpreted and transcribed by the voice recognition system (physical-physical), which in turn triggers automatic drawing in space. A series of real-time pen movements are broken down and resynthesised as starting data for the system's machine drawings.
Today, physical space acts as a possible medium for collecting digital information.
<div class="hovertext" id="hover8">Architecture Scriptures</div> is the project created by Alberto Harres at HfK Bremen in 2022  that explores possible future pasts, speculating on the coming of our digital traces through an ancestral-futuristic perspective, provoking a discussion on continuity, preservation and archiving. In this specific case, the investigation concerns how the ceramic drawing machine can become a tool for collecting (digital-physicial) information.
<br></br>
Will it be possible in the future to integrate physical space and the data produced repeatedly in space within a machine that acts as a digital system capable of bringing the integration process back into a spatial performance?
As designers, what will be our role in setting the whole system into action? How will the relationship with the machine move forward?
