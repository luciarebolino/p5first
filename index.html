        <p>Research is developed through drawings, within the discourse between art and science. The performative calligraphies of space thus involve scientific aspects that are strictly data-driven, and drawing becomes an investigative tool of enquiry.</p>
        <p>Scientific tools provide a new lens through which to investigate space that would otherwise remain invisible. Computation becomes a process tool in which the interaction between the digital and the physical finds new calligraphic dimensions.        </p>
