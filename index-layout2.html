    <h3>Graphics Project Workshop Day 1</h3>

        Jonathan Jackson</strong>, Co-Founder, <a class="neon" href="https://wsdia.com/">We Should Do It All</a></p>

    <p>7:45 pm <strong>When Attitudes Become Form
        JiEun Rim</strong>, Associate Design Director, <a class="neon" href="">2x4</a></p>

    <p><strong>Graphics Project</strong> is an annual series of lectures, discussions, and portfolio reviews exploring the role of graphic design within the field of architecture organized by <strong>Yoonjai Choi</strong>.</p>

    <p>We examine various methods of visual communication used to convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and additional resources are available on the <a class="neon" href="">Graphics Project Webpage</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Graphics Project Workshops are open to all current GSAPP Students. Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting. <a class="neon" href="">details on day 2 presentations here</a>.</em></p>
